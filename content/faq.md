## Can others join the project?

Yes! Here is our {{< button "Registration Form" "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-_PF1vNUz5JVeMqPTumur4N5AXDbc1aa4DLK5PfDT2islYQ/viewform?embedded=true" />}}

## What does the project require?

Volunteers set up a route and survey it at least 8 times during the warm season, 4 times before 15 July and 4 times after 15 July, counting any butterflies observed within 20 feet of the volunteer.  Ideally volunteers will survey the route over several years to record changes in butterfly populations.  While surveying, volunteers record their findings on paper, then transfer them to a website once finished.  Training is required, and available on the Resources page.

While volunteers are encouraged to take pictures, all butterflies within the 20 foot are counted. Uploading information while surveying is not necessary, and is actually discouraged.  The focus is on moving at a steady pace and recording observations.

Volunteers should have a butterfly guide for their area that they can take along.  An iNaturalist account is helpful for IDing butterflies from pictures taken, but there is no need to access iNaturalist in the field while surveying.

## Do I need experience identifying butterflies before joining?

No! While experience is helpful, volunteers learn about common as well as rarer species of butterflies as they survey their route. 

## What is a route?

A route is any consistent path that a person can go along at a slow pace.  Routes should include at least one 'natural' habitat.

## How long should a route be?

A route should take between 30 min to 2 hours to travel at a steady pace. The distance depends, generally 1-3 miles.

## How many different habitats can a route have?

Each route must have at least 1 habitat and no more than 5.  Habitats may occur more than once along a route.

## How are habitats named?

Habitats are named by the route founder, the first person to establish the route.  Habitat names are not standardized, so monitors should choose descriptive names. In urban areas, 'roadside' is a common name.  Other common habitat names are prairie, savannah, neighborhood, woodland edge. Habitats along water may be named for example riparian, wetland, marsh, shoreline, depending on the exact habitat.  For wooded areas, including the dominant tree species in the name may be helpful.

# Texas Butterflies Monitoring

This repository holds all the files for this website.

## Workflow

1. Go to file of page to be edited.
1. Edit as needed.
1. Commit to new branch.
2. Create a pull request.
3. Wait for Github bot to generate a message as a comment to pull request.  This comment will contain a link to a temporary website.
4. If the temporary site looks fine, merge and confirm merge.
5. After a few minutes, check the live website for updates.
6. If changes don't appear, refresh.

## Troubleshooting

If no comment is added to the pull request, you may have opened the pull request against the main branch.  Close pull request and copy to the changes and redo changes against main branch.

If the link to the temporary website produces a 404 page, DO NOT commit the changes.  Wait about 5 min before admitting failure.
